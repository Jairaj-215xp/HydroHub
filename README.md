## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project (for Authentication and Firestore).
- A local static server (e.g., VS Code [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or Python's `http.server`) to allow ES6 Module imports to function correctly.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jairaj-215xp/HydroHub.git
   cd HydroHub
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a file named `env.js` in the `js/` directory (you can use `js/env.example.js` as a template).
   - Export your Firebase config variables (API key, project ID, auth domain, etc.).
   - ⚠️ **Important:** Never commit your `env.js` with real API keys to version control. It is ignored in `.gitignore`.

3. **Run Locally**
   Using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
